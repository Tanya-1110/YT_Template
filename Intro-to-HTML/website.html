<!--html is a tool to create websites. html stands for Hyper Text Markup language-->

<!--HTML element is the generic term that we use to describe anything that we can display on webpage. Like Button, paragraph etc-->
<!-- Syntax - rule for writing the code (Grammar for code)-->
<!--<button> is the HTML Tag with button as Tag name -->
<!--every element consists of 2 tags opening and closing tag both are same just closing tag with slash in front of it-->    
<!--<Tag Name> Content </Tag Name>-->

<!--href = "https://www.youtube.com/" <- this is an HTML attribute (modifies how an element behaves)-->
<!--href is attribute name and  value in double quotes is called attribute value-->
<!--We can have multiple attributes on an element and can be generated by having space in between the two-->

<!--href and target attributes works only on anchor tag not on others -->
<!--Extra spaces are ignored by HTML in content also-->
