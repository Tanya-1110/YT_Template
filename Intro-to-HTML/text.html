<!--TEXT STYLES-->
<!--font-family is used to change the font of the text-->
<!--Paragraph tags comes with the default margin of 14 px both at top and bottom-->
<!--width is used to shift the text onto next line-->
<!--line-height is used to adjust inbetween the lines of text-->

<!--We can clean our code by font-family under p tag directly as it is common to every text-->
<!--CSS specificity when same property is changed at multiple places then browser follows priority and priority of selectors a high priority selector is selected by browser-->
<!--Text element is inside the text like strong element(to bold the text in the statement) , u element(to underline the text), span element()-->
<!--Span element is the most generic element and has no styles-->

<!--General technique is Create HTML element and style them one by one and if we want changes in particular section of text use text element span for it-->
