<!--IMAGES-->

<!--We can load image from youtube by clicking on compute hovering that and finally in element section we can get the URL of the image and save that image to the vscode editor tree (Beside the html file)-->
<!--If we change width of the image through CSS then its height also changes accordingly in order to maintain same dimensions but we change the height too with width then dimensions will change and the image will look abrupt as the image will be stretched more than required-->
<!--Img elements has its own properties like (object-fit: cover) it tries to cover both width and height of image to maintion object size which may or may not covers whole view of the website
    and other value that can have by (object-position: contain) which shrinks the image until is it contained inbetween height and width-->
<!--We can adjust which part of the screen we want to see by CSS property called (object-position: left) if the image doesn't fit the entire screen-->


<!--TEXTBOXES-->

<!--input element can have mutiple attributes like type, placeholder(it puts a label for the user to type what that text box is meant and placeholder label will be removed once we start typing in it)-->
<!--values that can be given to type attribute in input element is like text, checkbox -->
<!--we can apply CSS roperties on search box-->

<!--CSS Display properties-->

<!--By using display property of css , we can decide whether our data(img, text, searchbox) to be in same line or in different lines-->

<!--HTML has 3 types of  basic elements 
1. Block element - Takes up the entire line . paragraph element is a block element (<p>) by default.
    (if we set block elements like p to width using class selector through css then make be the block for it get restricted but still some unknown margin will be there on it).

2. Inline Block element - It takes up as much space as needed and not entire line.
   (like img and input element are side by side as both are consuming as much space is required by them).

3. Inline element - They appear within a line of text. 
   (example is strong text element <strong> which converts specific area of the entire text by making them bold in nature.)


    out of all 3 elements block and inline block element are important as they decide how our data on display will look like.
-->

<!--we can use css display property to switch between block and inline block elements-->

<!-- we can target two classes with same set of css styling by separting the classes with comma-->

<!--The Div element-->

<!-- It is one of the most important html element-->
<!--Div stands for division and in a easy way it is just a box -->
<!--div is a block element by default so it takes up the entire line on webpage-->
<!-- by changing display property of div element from block to inline block. div element becomes like a container with a text, img or anything in it-->
<!--Why div is so useful ?  -->
<!-- As it can contain any other elements inside it . It can be anything like text, images, another divs-->
<!-- To handle real life complex problems , we need containers called div to group things together and lay them out on our page-->


<!--By using div element on multiple html elements, we are actually making them to contrained them in a container 
    Like block elements will behave by taking up the entire line in their container not on entire webpage.
-->

<!--vertical-align property aligns the two different containers at the top with value top-->

<!--Nested Layouts Technique-->

<!--There are 2 types of Nested layouts technique
    1. vertical layout - items are arranged by being on top of others.
    2. horizontal layout - items are beside each other.

 By the combination of vertical and horizontal layouts we can create anything that we see on website.
  
 we have to use layout with vertical layouts with horizontal layouts inside and further vertical layouts inside it, is called nested layout techniques.

 We have to use div elements to create various parts of the layout.
-->

<!-- paragraphs comes with margin at top and bottom by default-->

<!-- Font sack - when a default font is provided so that if first one fails then the default one may work for font-family property-->
<!--We had first set our paragraph elements to margin to 0 so that we can later have more precise margins as per our choice in between text-->

<!--CSS GRID-->

<!--It is useful for creating horizontal layout in much better way and grid of the website-->
<!--display: inline block has problem of spacing between the elements -->

<!--FLEXBOX-->

<!--It is another way for creating layouts and will use it to create header of the project-->
<!--It is similar to CSS grid but with more flexibility-->

<!--Nested Flexbox-->

<!--Flexbox covers only top layer of div so for other layers (inside) to work as flexbox we have to convert innerone 1st layer to be flexone-->

<!--css Position-->

<!--It helps to keep header and sidebar intact on the web page even by movement of the page-->

<!--Element on top of other element in css-->


<!--Responsive Design - idea is to make website look good for every screen size (media Query (@media()))-->


<!--Inheritance in elements - css applied onto the outer element has been pass onto the inner elements. And css properties related to text like text-decoration, font-weight, font-family supported by inhertiance but inheritance doesn't support properties like border, padding, margin. 
    Inheritance saves from writing a lot of same code again and again -->

<!--css Specificity - same elements styled with same property but with different values will give priority to that property which is more specifically applied (or to the innermost div)-->  

<!--Semantic Elements- they are same as <div> but has special meaning to search engine and screen readers(robots). example- 
    <header> - has the header for page, 
    <nav> - navigate to other link either on same page or onto different page, 
    <main> - termed or has the main part of screen, 
    <section> - holds a part of the main section. -->
